# Educational-Attainment
This project compares the average educational attainment of each racial group in the United States and compares it to the national average using Excel and PowerBI. If you do not have PowerBI installed on your computer, the report is available in PDF though it is not interactive.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from the United States Census Bureau. Table 3. Detailed Years of School Completed by People 25 Years and Over by Sex, Age Groups, Race and Hispanic Origin: 2021. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 
# Data Cleansing
To make the data more readable, I combined all the smaller subgroups into one larger group using Excel and Power Query in PowerBI. Ex: "Less than 1 year college, no degree" "One year of college, no degree" "Two years of college, no degree" "Three years of college, no degree" "Four or more years of college, no degree" became Elementary or High school, no diploma. I also only used the percentage columns of each group.
